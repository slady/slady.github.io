# IDEA

IDEA is the current IDE of choice for Java.

IDEA comes in two editions:
* Community (that means Free)
* Ultimate (tat means Paid)

The paid version has a DB Navigator, JavaScript, enhanced Java code analysis
and built-in support for Java frameworks like Spring, Java EE, GWT, Vaadin and probably other.

The JetBrains also sells IDEs for PHP, C/C# and JavaScript.

# eclipse

Second IDE is eclipse, that was around here before IDEA had been born.

Today it is outdated as it lacks built-in support for maven and git.

eclipse has separate editions for other languages like PHP and C/C++.

# NetBeans

Third in the line is NetBeans, which was the official IDE of Sun Microsystems, back in the old days...

It has support for JavaScript, PHP, C/C++,
maven, ant, gradle and database tools.
